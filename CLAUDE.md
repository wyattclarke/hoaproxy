# HOAproxy — Claude Code Instructions

## Project Overview
HOAproxy is a semantic search / Q&A platform for HOA documents, with a proxy voting system and legal corpus. Stack: FastAPI, SQLite (WAL mode), Qdrant vector DB, OpenAI embeddings.

**"HOA" always includes condos.** Throughout this project — discovery, banking, ingest, search — "HOA" is shorthand for any community association governing real property by recorded covenants, including condominium associations (FL Chapter 718, equivalents in other states), townhome/master/property-owners associations, and traditional Chapter-720-style HOAs. The bank captures all of them under the same `gs://hoaproxy-bank/v1/{STATE}/{county}/{slug}/` layout. Statute-level routing is the drain worker's job, not discovery's.

**Key files:**
- `api/main.py` — FastAPI app (all routes)
- `hoaware/db.py` — SQLite schema + all CRUD functions
- `hoaware/auth.py` — JWT auth, password hashing
- `hoaware/config.py` — Settings loaded from `settings.env` or env vars
- `hoaware/law.py` — Query API for state HOA law rules
- `hoaware/proxy_templates.py` — Jinja2 proxy form template engine
- `hoaware/esign.py` — E-signature abstraction (click-to-sign MVP)
- `hoaware/email_service.py` — Email delivery stub (logs only)
- `api/static/js/auth.js` — Shared frontend auth (JWT in localStorage, Bearer injection)

## Environment Setup
```bash
# Python 3.10+; .venv lives in project root
python3.10 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
pip install pytest httpx  # test deps, not in requirements.txt
```

Settings are loaded from `settings.env` (gitignored). Copy `settings.env.example` to get started:
```bash
cp settings.env.example settings.env
# Edit settings.env with your API keys
```

Key values:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY` — secret, get from OpenAI dashboard
- `JWT_SECRET` — secret, use a strong random string in production
- `HOA_DB_PATH=data/hoa_index.db`
- `HOA_DOCS_ROOT=hoa_docs`
- `QDRANT_URL=http://localhost:6333` (local; no API key needed locally)
- `HOA_CHUNK_CHAR_LIMIT=1800`, `HOA_CHUNK_OVERLAP=200`

**Google Document AI (sole OCR provider):**
- `HOA_ENABLE_DOCAI=1` (default in production) + configure `HOA_DOCAI_PROJECT_ID`, `HOA_DOCAI_LOCATION`, `HOA_DOCAI_PROCESSOR_ID`
- `GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS` — path to your GCP service account key file (gitignored)
- Tesseract is **not** in the runtime path. Scanned pages with no DocAI configured come back blank.

**macOS dev (Tahoe / 26.x):** Apple's `Network.framework` is not fork-safe and crashes in `nw_path_*` / NAT64 evaluation when a Python parent that has already initialized SSL or done DNS work spawns a child (orchestrators do this via `subprocess.run([sys.executable, ...])` in `state_scrapers/*/scripts/run_state_ingestion.py` and the FL enrichers). Symptom: `EXC_BAD_ACCESS` with "crashed on child side of fork pre-exec". Mitigation — export in your shell profile and add to `settings.env`:
```bash
export OBJC_DISABLE_INITIALIZE_FORK_SAFETY=YES
```
This is a local-only workaround; production (Hetzner/Linux) is unaffected. Do not paper over it by switching to `multiprocessing` with `fork` — the fix is to keep using `subprocess`/spawn semantics.

## Running & Testing
```bash
# Run API server
uvicorn api.main:app --reload

# Run all tests
python -m pytest tests/ -q

# Legal corpus pipeline
python3 scripts/legal/run_pipeline.py --skip-validate --include-aggregators
```

## Frontend Style
Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS — no build step, no framework. Match existing style:
- Fonts: Manrope (body), Space Grotesk (headings)
- Colors: `--accent: #1662f3`, `--bg: #eef5ff`, `--ink: #12233a`
- Auth: always load `/static/js/auth.js`, use `Auth.renderNav()`, `Auth.requireAuth()`, `Auth.fetchJson()`

## Document Ingestion (agent-driven)

**Read `docs/agent-ingestion.md`** for the full design, API contract, categories, OCR routing, cost guards, and a worked example. Quick summary:

- Agents discover an HOA, fetch a polygon (OSM/Nominatim), classify each candidate PDF with `python scripts/hoa_precheck.py`, then `POST /upload` with parallel form arrays (`files`, `categories`, `text_extractable`, `source_urls`).
- Server routes extraction on the agent's `text_extractable` hint. DocAI is the sole OCR provider; tesseract is gone.
- Daily DocAI spend is capped at `DAILY_DOCAI_BUDGET_USD` (default $20); `/upload` returns 429 over the cap.
- VALID categories: `ccr, bylaws, articles, rules, amendment, resolution, minutes, financial, insurance`. PII categories (`membership_list, ballot, violation`) are refused at the API.

**Phase 2 async cutover (2026-05-11):** `ASYNC_INGEST_ENABLED=1` is now live. `/upload` and `/admin/ingest-ready-gcs` enqueue into the `pending_ingest` SQLite queue and return `202`-shape `{queued: true, job_id, status_url}`. A co-located worker process (`hoaware.ingest_worker`, started by `scripts/start_web_with_worker.sh`) drains the queue with a separate Python heap. The 75s `/upload` pacing memo no longer applies. See `docs/phase2-cutover.md` for the runbook and `docs/scaling-proposal.md` for the design. Poll job status at `GET /ingest/status/{job_id}`; admin queue stats at `GET /admin/ingest/queue-stats`; dead-letter retry at `POST /admin/ingest/retry-dead`.

**No batch-import / per-corpus / queue scripts.** If you're tempted to write one, you're working against the design.

For the one-time prod cleanup still pending after the migration, see `docs/ops-cleanup.md`.

## Document Bank (decoupled discovery)

`hoaware.bank` + `hoaware.discovery` form a write-only document sink on GCS, separate from the production ingest path. Discovery agents bank what they find; a future drain worker reads manifests back out and feeds `/upload`.

- **Bucket:** `gs://hoaproxy-bank/` (override with `HOA_BANK_GCS_BUCKET`).
- **Layout:** `v1/{STATE}/{county}/{hoa-slug}/manifest.json` + `doc-{sha[:12]}/original.pdf`.
- **Probe a single lead:** `python -m hoaware.discovery probe --name "Foo HOA" --state VA --website https://...`
- **Probe a batch:** `python -m hoaware.discovery probe-batch leads.jsonl` (one Lead JSON per line).
- **Writing a new source:** produce `hoaware.discovery.Lead` instances and call `probe(lead)`. Don't write directly to GCS — `bank_hoa()` handles slug normalization, dedup, and parallel-writer merge.

The bank is *not* the ingest pipeline. `/upload` still owns ingest; the bank is the upstream pool a drain worker will eventually feed from. Don't read `gs://hoaproxy-bank/` from `api/main.py`.

## State Scraping

When starting a fresh state-scraping session (covering one or more US states/DC), read `docs/multi-state-ingestion-playbook.md` first. It is the canonical, tier-stratified playbook (Tier 0 tiny → Tier 4 huge), supersedes the prior small-state plan / discovery playbook / bank-to-live plan / GCS prepared plan / prompt template, and includes:

- the per-tier run shape (parallel autonomous batches for tiny states; phased operator-supervised for larger ones)
- the `is_dirty()` name-quality gate at the bank, now backed by `hoaware/name_utils.py`
- the mandatory Phase 10 retrospective at `state_scrapers/{state}/notes/retrospective.md` (see GA, RI, TN exemplars)

## Audit + Backfill Pipeline

For content-quality auditing, registry-stub backfills, and cleanup of polluted bulk imports, see **[`docs/audit-pipeline.md`](docs/audit-pipeline.md)**. Historical incident record at `state_scrapers/_orchestrator/quality_audit_2026_05_09/FINAL_REPORT.md`.

**Hard rules that cost data the painful way — read before touching live HOA rows in bulk:**

1. **Don't `/admin/delete-hoa` then `/admin/create-stub-hoas`** to refresh a row. The cascade strips `latitude`, `longitude`, `boundary_geojson`, `street`, `postal_code`, and `location_quality`. Use `/admin/clear-hoa-docs` instead — it deletes documents + chunks while preserving the entity and geometry.
2. **`/admin/create-stub-hoas` bulk runs must pass `on_collision: "disambiguate"`.** The `"skip"` default exists as a safety guard for one-off uploads and silently drops cross-state name collisions.
3. **Subdivisions / plats are NOT HOAs.** County GIS `*_subdivisions` and `*_plats` layers are mostly recorded land subdivisions without mandatory associations. Always run `scripts/audit/grade_entity_names.py --source-filter <source>` to sample-grade names BEFORE bulk backfilling a new source.
4. **Never reuse an existing `hoa_locations.source` string.** Source strings are the primary key for `/admin/list-corruption-targets` and future scrubs. Pick a fresh one per source. The 2026-05-09–10 burned source list is in the FINAL_REPORT.
5. **Both `/admin/backfill-locations` and `/admin/create-stub-hoas` COALESCE every column.** Passing `location_quality: "city_only"` against a row that already has `"address"` quality silently demotes it. Either omit the field (NULL) or pass a quality at least as good as what's there.
6. **Before any bulk backfill, take a snapshot: `POST /admin/backup-full`.** The cron `/admin/backup` only dumps the precious-tables subset; it is NOT a full DB backup.

To decide where to scrape next: `GET /admin/state-doc-coverage` returns per-state `{live, with_docs, without_docs, with_docs_pct}` in one SQL aggregation.

## Proxy Voting System
See `docs/proxy-voting-plan.md` for full details.

**Key patterns:**
- DB startup migration: `lifespan` handler in `api/main.py` runs `db.SCHEMA` + expiry sweep on boot
- Rate limiter: in-memory per-IP, `_check_rate_limit(request, limit=N)` — skips `testclient` host
- Health check (`/healthz`): verifies all required tables exist, returns 503 if missing
- E-sign: click-to-sign MVP
- Email: `EMAIL_PROVIDER=stub|resend|smtp`; defaults to stub (logs only)
- Data retention: `PROXY_RETENTION_DAYS=90`; expiry sweep runs on startup

**Test isolation pattern:** module-level temp DB + `os.environ["HOA_DB_PATH"]`. FK delete order: `proxy_audit → proxy_assignments → delegates → membership_claims → sessions → users`.

**Proxy lifecycle:** `draft → signed → delivered → acknowledged / revoked / expired`

**Route ordering rule:** In `api/main.py`, always define specific routes (`/proxies/mine`) before parameterized routes (`/proxies/{proxy_id}`).

## Legal Corpus Pipeline
ETL pipeline in `scripts/legal/`:
`build_source_map.py` → `fetch_law_texts.py` → `normalize_law_texts.py` → `extract_rules.py` → `assemble_profiles.py` → `validate_corpus.py`

- Rules stored in `legal_corpus/metadata/extracted_rules.jsonl` (not SQLite)
- Source registry: `data/legal/state_source_registry.json`
- All 51 jurisdictions now have official source URLs in the registry (OK, PA, SD, WY were migrated from dead aggregator URLs to oscn.net, palegis.us, sdlegislature.gov/api, wyoleg.gov, oklegislature.gov)

## Production Deployment (Hetzner)

Production runs on a Hetzner Cloud CCX23 (Hillsboro, OR; IPv4 `5.78.221.146`) fronted by Cloudflare → Caddy → docker-compose → uvicorn (FastAPI + ingest worker in one container). The full migration runbook is `docs/migrate-to-hetzner.md`; the operational pieces you need day-to-day:

- **Host paths:**
  - Repo: `/home/hoaproxy/hoaproxy` (the `hoaproxy` user owns it)
  - SQLite DB: `/var/lib/hoaproxy/data/hoa_index.db` (host NVMe; mounted into the container at `/app/data/hoa_index.db`)
  - PDFs: `/var/lib/hoaproxy/hoa_docs` (200 GB Hetzner Cloud Volume; mounted into the container at `/app/hoa_docs`)
  - Secrets: `/etc/hoaproxy/hoaproxy.env` and `/etc/hoaproxy/gcp-sa.json` (root:hoaproxy, mode 0640)
  - Caddy config: `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile` (cert + IP allowlist for Cloudflare edge)
  - Compose file: `~/hoaproxy/deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml`
- **Deploy a change:**
  ```bash
  git push origin master
  ssh hoaproxy@5.78.221.146 'cd hoaproxy && bash deploy/deploy.sh'
  ```
  `deploy/deploy.sh` does `git fetch && git reset --hard origin/master`, rebuilds the image, and recreates the `hoaproxy-app` container with a healthcheck wait. ~30s downtime; Cloudflare serves a brief 5xx during the swap.
- **Restart / logs / shell:** `docker compose -f ~/hoaproxy/deploy/docker-compose.prod.yml restart app`, `docker compose ... logs -f app`, `docker exec -it hoaproxy-app bash`.
- **Rollback DNS to Render** (if Hetzner is broken): `bash deploy/cutover-dns.sh --rollback` — but Render is suspended now, so don't rollback unless you've also un-suspended it.

## Database Backup
- `POST /admin/backup` — snapshots SQLite DB via `VACUUM INTO`, uploads to GCS bucket `hoaproxy-backups`
- Protected by admin auth (`Bearer {JWT_SECRET}`)
- Triggered twice daily (6am/6pm ET) by cron-job.org
- Blobs stored as `gs://hoaproxy-backups/db/hoa_index-{timestamp}.db`
- GCS uses the `hoaware-ocr` service account (same as Document AI)
- **Recovery:** download the latest blob from `gs://hoaproxy-backups/db/`, then `bash ~/hoaproxy/deploy/restore-from-gcs.sh` on the Hetzner host (it moves the current `hoa_index.db` aside first). The DB lives at `/var/lib/hoaproxy/data/hoa_index.db` on the host, mounted into the container at `/app/data/hoa_index.db`.
- Qdrant does NOT need backup — it's rebuildable by re-running the ingestion pipeline

## Data Directories (not in git)
- `data/` — SQLite DBs, Qdrant local store
- `hoa_docs/` — HOA document library (uploaded PDFs)
- `legal_corpus/` — Raw/normalized law texts
- `settings.env` — Secrets

## Working Style
- Proceed autonomously — do not ask clarifying questions unless truly blocked
- Commit after each milestone with a descriptive message
- Write tests as you go; fix failures before moving on
- This is a real product, not a prototype — write clean, production-quality code
- Do not over-engineer; keep solutions focused on what's asked
- Security: load secrets from `settings.env` via `os.environ`, never hardcode or echo in commands/logs
